# Chitr

**A Twitter clone in Ruby and Sinatra.**

A weekend challenge at Makers Academy – we were simply told to "build Twitter" and given a list of specifications to use as a starting point for our feature tests. Quite daunting! But here it is – a very simple Twitter clone, fully test-driven using Cucumber, Capybara and RSpec, written in Ruby and using Sinatra.

## The stack

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* Postgres and DataMapper
* Twitter Bootstrap

For testing:
* RSpec
* Cucumber/Gherkin
* Capybara

Running on Heroku.
